- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)? State is declared in one place and reused throughout the app
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes. 
componentDidUpdate- re-renders DOM elements when the state changes
componentDidMount- called once and used for API calls, this method is a sign the component rendered properly
componentWillUnMount- adds cleans ups
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    to make code as DRY as possible, they can be reused within the app
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
It is important to test apps because minor bugs could cause more serious issues after release. If code is tested, you will know where the bugs are.
